    <p>As seen in the board above, chess boards are labeled per row and column; columns are labeled from a-h and rows are labeled from 1-8. This makes each square have its own label, for example, the white king, at the beginning of the game, is located at e1.</p>
    <p>Chess matches are generally timed. The most common time control nowadays is 10 minutes for each player, a close second being 5 minutes. There are other time controls such as 15 | 10, each match lasting 15 minutes, however, each move adds 10 seconds.</p>
